# San Francisco Parking Meters Visualisation

I was given 24 hours and challenged to visualise a San Francisco parking meter dataset, in whichever way I saw fit, as part of an internship interview process.

## Note

This project no longer functions, as the Google Maps API and sfgov data API were updated in ways which weren't backwards compatible and I've moved on to bigger, better things. The repo serves as a reminder of when I was just starting to get to grips with JavaScript and how far I've come since one of my first projects with the language. Feel free to laugh or cringe at the code and my casual use of retrospective READMEs.
